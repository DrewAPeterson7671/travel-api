This week we'll create our own Rails API using RESTful principles. Rails 5 includes built-in functionality to quickly scaffold an API-only application. Here are the topics we'll explore:

Building an API that includes full CRUD functionality and nested routes
Successfully returning JSON objects via Postman and cURL
Returning headers with the correct HTTP status code
Testing APIs with rspec request specs
Documenting your API endpoints
Handling exceptions when an API call fails
You're also encouraged to do further exploration:

Authenticating API users with a stateless token
Versioning your API
Using a serializer to normalize JSON data
Creating API endpoints with custom routes
Independent Project
At the end of the week, your independent project will be reviewed for successful implementation of the following features:

Application successfully returns responses for each API call.
Application handles exceptions.
Application includes custom routes and model scopes.
All routes are tested with request specs.
README thoroughly describes all endpoints along with parameters that can be used.
Application works as expected.
Project is in a presentable, portfolio-quality state.
Project demonstrates understanding of all concepts covered this week. If prompted, you can discuss your application with an instructor using the correct terminology.
